Booking Channel Analysis Report
Overview
This project provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis of a hotel booking dataset to uncover key business insights, identify booking trends, and propose actionable strategies. The analysis leverages Python to perform a detailed investigation into customer booking and cancellation behaviors across various dimensions, including booking channels, room types, star ratings, and seasonal factors. The findings are intended to support strategic decision-making for a hotel business aiming to optimize revenue and enhance customer retention.

Problem Statement
The core objectives of this analysis were to:

Identify Key Observations: Uncover significant trends and patterns in the hotel booking data, such as month-over-month booking volumes and day-of-week cancellation rates.

Root Cause Analysis: Investigate the factors contributing to high cancellation rates and understand why certain booking channels or property types consistently outperform others. This includes analyzing the impact of lead time and price sensitivity.

Business Recommendations: Develop actionable, data-backed strategies to minimize cancellations, improve profitability, and optimize pricing and channel distribution strategies.

Technologies Used
The project was developed using a standard data science stack in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

Python: The primary programming language used for the analysis.

Pandas: Essential for data cleaning, preparation, and manipulation.

NumPy: Used for efficient numerical operations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Employed to create clear and compelling data visualizations for the report and notebook.

Dataset
The dataset includes a variety of fields related to customer, property, and booking information. Key columns used for this analysis are:

Customer & Property: customer_id, property_id, city, star_rating

Booking Details: booking_date, check_in_date, check_out_date, lead_time, num_rooms_booked, room_type, stay_type, booking_channel, channel_of_booking

Financials: booking_value, costprice, markup, selling_price, refund_amount

Transactional Data: payment_method, refund_status, cashback, coupon_redeem, Coupon USed?, booking_status, is_canceled (a derived flag for cancellations)

Methodology
The analysis was conducted using a structured, Python-based approach as documented in the main.ipynb notebook. The key steps involved:

Data Cleaning & Preparation: The raw dataset was loaded and a new column, is_canceled, was created from the booking_status column to simplify the analysis. Date columns (booking_date, check_in_date) were converted to the correct data type to enable time-based analysis. Missing values were handled, and duplicates were removed to ensure data quality.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Descriptive statistics were generated for all columns to understand the data's distribution and identify potential outliers. Key metrics like the overall cancellation rate were calculated (approximately 20.2%).

Data Wrangling & Transformation: The pandas library was used to create bins for lead_time to analyze its impact on cancellations, and to extract the day of the week for check_in_date. Pivot tables and aggregations were used to compare cancellation rates and booking values across different segments.

Visualization & Reporting: Matplotlib and Seaborn were utilized to generate a series of plots, including bar charts showing booking volumes by channel and room type, a line plot for monthly booking trends, and a heatmap for cancellation rates by room type and star rating. These visualizations were used to support the insights and findings presented in the report.

Key Findings
The analysis revealed several important patterns and insights:

Booking Channels: Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) account for a significant portion of booking volume but also have the highest cancellation rates. Direct bookings, while smaller in volume, are more stable with a lower cancellation rate.

Cancellation Behavior:

Day of Week: The highest cancellation rate occurs for bookings with a Friday check-in (5.1%), followed by Monday (4.3%).

Lead Time: The cancellation rate is not linear with lead time. It peaks for last-minute bookings and for bookings made 12-18 days in advance, suggesting different types of booking behavior (impulse vs. price-sensitive searching).

Property & Room Types:

Star Rating: Average booking value is relatively consistent across 2, 3, 4, and 5-star properties, indicating a stable pricing strategy. However, the cancellation rate for 5-star properties is the highest when combined with certain room types (e.g., Deluxe rooms).

Room Type: Standard rooms have the highest booking volume, while premium rooms (e.g., Suites) show seasonal booking peaks.

Business Recommendations
Based on these findings, the following recommendations are proposed to improve business performance and profitability:

Reduce Cancellations:

Dynamic Cancellation Policies: Implement a tiered cancellation policy with stricter rules for last-minute and weekend bookings. Offer flexible, more lenient policies for advance, non-peak bookings to encourage commitment.

Incentivize Commitment: Offer loyalty points or small discounts for non-refundable bookings or for those who pay in full upfront.

Targeted Communication: Use the lead_time and check_in_date insights to send targeted reminders and promotions to customers in high-risk segments (e.g., last-minute weekend bookings) to reduce cancellations.

Increase Profitability:

Shift to Direct Bookings: Launch aggressive campaigns on social media and email to promote special offers for direct bookings on the hotel's website or app.

Upsell & Cross-sell: Increase the average booking value by promoting add-on services (e.g., airport transfers, spa packages, room upgrades) during the booking process.

Optimize OTA Commissions: Review performance and cancellation rates by OTA and negotiate better commission rates for channels that drive high-value, low-cancellation bookings.

Optimize Pricing & Channel Strategy:

Dynamic Pricing: Implement a dynamic pricing model that adjusts rates in real-time based on demand, lead time, and channel performance.

Seasonal Packages: Promote long-stay packages or off-season discounts to stabilize revenue during periodic dips in monthly booking volumes.

How to Run the Project
To run this analysis, you will need a Python environment with Jupyter Notebook installed.

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Ensure you have the required libraries installed by running:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Open main.ipynb in your Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab environment.

Run all the cells in the notebook to replicate the data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.

Future Work
Predictive Modeling: Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a booking being canceled, allowing for proactive intervention.

Customer Segmentation: Use unsupervised learning to segment customers based on their booking behavior, stay_type, and room_type to create more personalized marketing campaigns.

Expand Analysis: Incorporate external data sources, such as local event calendars or flight data, to enrich the analysis and better understand seasonal trends.
