The core objectives of this analysis were to:

- **Identify Key Observations**: Discover trends in booking volumes, cancellation rates, and channel performance.  
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Understand factors contributing to cancellations and why certain channels or property types outperform others.  
- **Business Recommendations**: Provide actionable strategies to minimize cancellations, improve profitability, and optimize pricing and channel distribution.

## Dataset
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Key columns used in the analysis:

- **Customer & Property**: `customer_id`, `property_id`, `city`, `star_rating`  
- **Booking Details**: `booking_date`, `check_in_date`, `check_out_date`, `lead_time`, `num_rooms_booked`, `room_type`, `stay_type`, `booking_channel`, `channel_of_booking`  
- **Financials**: `booking_value`, `costprice`, `markup`, `selling_price`, `refund_amount`  
- **Transactional Data**: `payment_method`, `refund_status`, `cashback`, `coupon_redeem`, `Coupon Used?`, `booking_status`, `is_canceled`  

</details>

## Methodology
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Created `is_canceled` flag, handled missing values, removed duplicates, and converted date columns.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generated descriptive statistics and calculated key metrics like overall cancellation rate (~20.2%).  
3. **Data Wrangling & Transformation**: Created bins for `lead_time`, extracted day-of-week, and used pivot tables to analyze cancellations and booking values.  
4. **Visualization & Reporting**: Bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps highlight booking patterns and support insights.

## Key Findings
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

- **Booking Channels**: OTAs dominate volume but have higher cancellations; direct bookings are more stable.  
- **Cancellation Behavior**:
  - **Day of Week**: Highest cancellations on Friday (5.1%) and Monday (4.3%).  
  - **Lead Time**: Peaks in last-minute and 12â€“18 day advance bookings.  
- **Property & Room Types**:
  - Star rating and room type affect cancellations and revenue patterns.  
  - Standard rooms have highest booking volumes; premium rooms show seasonal peaks.

## Business Recommendations
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

- **Reduce Cancellations**:
  - Implement dynamic, tiered cancellation policies.  
  - Offer incentives for non-refundable bookings.  
  - Target high-risk segments with reminders/promotions.  

- **Increase Profitability**:
  - Promote direct bookings via campaigns.  
  - Upsell/cross-sell services during booking.  
  - Optimize OTA commissions based on performance.  

- **Optimize Pricing & Channel Strategy**:
  - Apply dynamic pricing models based on demand and lead time.  
  - Introduce seasonal packages and long-stay offers.
